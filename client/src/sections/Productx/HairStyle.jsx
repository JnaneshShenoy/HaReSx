          Ever wonder what you would look like with a different hairstyle?
          <br />
          Now, you can easily try out new looks without ever needing to cut or
          style your hair! Our system helps you see what you would look like
          with a brand-new hairstyle in just a few steps.

          How Does It Work? We use a special kind of computer program called CNN
          (Convolutional Neural Network). It is a tool that helps computers look
          at pictures and recognize patternsâ€”like the shape of your face or how
          your hair flows. Do not worry about the science part, we have made it
          super easy to use! Just upload a picture of yourself, and our system
          will show you what you would look like with that new look.
